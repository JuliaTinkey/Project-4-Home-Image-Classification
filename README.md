# Project-4-Home-Image-Classification
Architectural Image Classification

The purpose of this project is to use image classification of different architectural styles common in the Charlotte Metro area.  The different architectural styles include: American Craftsman, Tudor Revival, and Queen Anne.

Plan:
  1. Use Keras to import and normalize the image data and split the images into testing and training groups. 
  2. Build a neural network to classify the home types. 
  3. Test the model to evaluate accuracy and make improvements.
