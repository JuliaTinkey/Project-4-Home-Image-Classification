# Project-4-Home-Image-Classification
Architectural Image Classification

The purpose of this project is to use image classification of different architectural styles common in the Charlotte Metro area.  The different architectural styles include: American Craftsman, Tudor Revival, and Queen Anne.

Plan:
  1. Use Keras to import and normalize the image data and split the images into testing and training groups. 
  2. Build a neural network to classify the home types. 
  3. Test the model to evaluate accuracy and make improvements.
  4. Use HTML to build a wesbite to classify an image: the website will allow someone to upload an image which will then classify the image among the three styles.

Applications/Tools:
  1. Machine Learning: 
      - Scikit-learn
      - Keras - implementing neural networks
      - cv2 & PIL (Pillow)- immage processing
      - NumPy
  3. HTML/CSS
  4. Python Pandas / Python Matplotlib

Topic- Image Classification via Architectural Style: 
  1. American Craftsman
  2. Tudor Revival
  3. Queen Anne

Data Source: Kaggle (images of 100-200 per style)
