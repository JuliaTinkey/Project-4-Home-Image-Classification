# Project-4-Home-Image-Classification
Architectural Image Classification

The purpose of this project is to use image classification of different architectural styles common in the Charlotte Metro area. Modern vs Tradition home styles were used as the database.

Plan:
  1. Use Keras to import and normalize the image data and split the images into testing and training groups. 
  2. Build a neural network to classify the home types. 
  3. Test the model to evaluate accuracy and make improvements.
  4. Use HTML to build a wesbite to classify an image: the website will allow someone to upload an image which will then classify the image among the Modern or Traditional style.

Applications/Tools:
  1. Machine Learning: 
      - Scikit-learn
      - Keras - implementing neural networks
      - cv2 (OpenCV) & PIL (Pillow)- image processing/recognition
      - NumPy
  3. HTML/CSS
  4. Python Pandas / Python Matplotlib

Topic- Image Classification via Architectural Style: 
  1. Modern: Bauhas , Deconstructivism, International Style, Postmodern, and Novelty Architecture
  2. Traditional: American Foursquare, Geogian, Tudor Revival, Greek Revival, Palladian, and Queen Anne Architecture.

Data Source: Kaggle (images of 100-200 per style)
